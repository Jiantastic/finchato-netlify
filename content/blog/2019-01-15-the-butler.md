At first glance, it might seem that the federal reserve data is incorrect, but a quick look at the y-axis (in millions of dollars) clears this up. The US national debt is not in fact 21 million but currently stands at 21 trillion!

This is probably the one aspect of our economy that perhaps not many people realise. That the Federal Reserve(and other central banks around the world) can effectively create money from nothing! Another interesting thing about our economy is that is it debt-based. Governments and companies raise debt(among other sources like cash and equity) to finance projects, and these projects pay for materials and human labour. Said humans then spend this money for food, rent and entertainment. This stimulates the economy and it grows, but what happens when the music stops?

A good book to understand how debt shapes our economy is Debt : The First 5,000 Years by David Graeber.
